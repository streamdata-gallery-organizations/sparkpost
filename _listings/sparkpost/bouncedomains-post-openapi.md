      summary: Create a Template
      description: |-
        Create a template by providing a **template object** as the POST request body.

        At a minimum, the "name" and "content" fields are required, where content must contain the "from", "subject", and at least one of "html" or "text" fields.

        By default, when a template is referenced in a transmission, it is the published version of that template.  To submit a transmission that uses a draft template, set the transmission field "use_draft_template" to true.  For additional details, see the Transmissions API documentation for Using a Stored Template.


        #### Create Parts

        The following are key points about creating parts in your templates, as shown in the example:

        * The "id" field may be supplied, and it must be unique.

        * By default, templates are created as drafts.  If you would like to directly publish a template upon creation, set the "published" field to true.

        * Open and click tracking may be enable/disabled at the template level using the "open_tracking" and
        "click_tracking" fields.

        * The "from" field may be a JSON object composed of "email" and "name".

        * A "Reply-To" header may be specified using the "reply_to" field.

        * Both "text" and "html" may be provided.

        * Additional headers may be specified in the "headers" JSON dictionary.


        #### Create RFC822

        Fully formed email_rfc822 content may be provided instead of the "text", "html", "from", and "subject" parts, as shown in the example.

        The result will include a "last_update_time" field. The "last_update_time" is the time the template was last updated, for both draft and published versions.

        Update an existing template by specifying its ID in the URI path and use a **template object** as the PUT request body.
        By default, the update will result in a new draft version, but the published version can be overwritten directly by using the **update_published** query parameter.

        The "name" field may be modified, but the "id" field is read only.

        If a content object is provided in the update request, it must
        contain all relevant content fields whether they are being changed or not.
        The new content will completely overwrite the existing content.

        The example shows an update that will rename the template, enable open tracking,
        and update the content all in one API call. All content fields are included whether they are being
        changed or not.

        Publishing a template is a specific case of an update.  The body of the PUT
        request should contain the `"published": true` field as shown in the example. The
        **update_published** query parameter does not apply.

        If a tracking domain is specified, it will replace any currently specified tracking domain.  If the supplied tracking domain is a blank string, it will clear any currently specified tracking domain. Note that if a tracking domain is not specified, any currently specified tracking domain will remain intact.

        If a dkim object is provided in the update request, it must contain all relevant fields whether they are being changed or not.  The new dkim object will completely overwrite the existing one.

        To remove the DKIM Signing Domain Identifier for a Sending Domain, use the empty string for the value of the dkim.signing_domain field. ( **Note**: dkim.signing_domain is only available in SparkPost Elite. )

      summary: Create a Transmission (metadata with stored template and inline recipients)
      description: "You can create a transmission in a number of ways. In all cases,
        you can use the **num_rcpt_errors** parameter to limit the number of recipient
        errors returned.\n\n**Note:** The \"return_path\" in the POST request body
        applies to SparkPost Elite only.\n\n**Note:** Sending limits apply to SparkPost
        only. When a transmission is created in SparkPost, the number of messages
        in the transmission is compared to the sending limit of your account. If the
        transmission will cause you to exceed your sending limit, the entire transmission
        results in an error and no messages are sent.  Note that no messages will
        be sent for the given transmission, regardless of the number of messages that
        caused you to exceed your sending limit. In this case, the Transmission API
        will return an HTTP 420 error code with an error detailing whether you would
        exceed your hourly, daily, or sandbox sending limit. \n\n#### Using Inline
        Email Part Content\n\nCreate a transmission using inline email part content.\n\n####
        Using Inline RFC822 Content\n\nCreate a transmission using inline RFC822 content.
        Content headers are not generated for transmissions providing RFC822 content.
        They are expected to be provided as headers contained in the RFC822 content.\n\n####
        Using a Stored Recipients List\n\nCreate a transmission using a stored recipients
        list by specifying the \"list_id\" in the \"recipients\" attribute.\n\n####
        Using a Stored Template\n\nCreate a transmission using a stored template by
        specifying the \"template_id\" in the \"content\" attribute.  The \"use_draft_template\"
        field is optional and indicates whether to use a draft version or the published
        version of the template when generating messages.\n\n#### Scheduling Transmissions\n\nCreate
        a scheduled transmission to be generated and sent at a future time by specifying
        \"start_time\" in the \"options\" attribute.\n\nScheduling a transmission
        that specifies a stored template will use the LATEST version of the template
        available at the time of scheduled generation.  The use of published versus
        draft versions follows the same logic in all transmission requests, whether
        scheduled or immediate generation. When \"use_draft_template\" is not specified
        (or set to false), the latest published version of the specified stored template
        is used. If \"use_draft_template\" is set to true, the latest draft version
        is used in the transmission instead.\n\nOnce message generation has been initiated,
        all messages in the transmission will use the template selected at the start
        of the generation. If a template update is made during the generation of a
        transmission that uses that template, the template update will succeed but
        the transmission will continue to use the version that was selected at the
        start of the generation."

        Update a webhook's properties by specifying its id in the URI path and use a **webhooks object** as
        the PUT request body.

        Note that batches currently queued for delivery to this webhook will not be affected by these
        modifications.  For example, if you change the webhook's target URL, batches already queued for delivery will still be POSTed to the previous URL.

        As described in "Webhooks Object Properties", a change to the _target_ value entails a test POST request to the URL given. If this request does not receive an HTTP 200 response, your request to the Webhooks API will fail with HTTP 400, and the webhook will not be modified.
