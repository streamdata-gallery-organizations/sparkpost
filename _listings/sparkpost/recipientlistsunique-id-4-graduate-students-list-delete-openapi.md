  title: SparkPost Delete a Recipient List
  description: |-
    Permanently delete the specified recipient list.

    Once a recipient list is deleted, it
    cannot be recovered.  Before deleting a list, ensure that it is no longer needed and keep a backup copy.  If a deleted
    list is needed again, the list must be resubmitted with the CREATE API.

    If a transmission contains a recipient list, the recipient list cannot be deleted if the transmission is
    submitted or generating.

      summary: Create a Template
      description: |-
        Create a template by providing a **template object** as the POST request body.

        At a minimum, the "name" and "content" fields are required, where content must contain the "from", "subject", and at least one of "html" or "text" fields.

        By default, when a template is referenced in a transmission, it is the published version of that template.  To submit a transmission that uses a draft template, set the transmission field "use_draft_template" to true.  For additional details, see the Transmissions API documentation for Using a Stored Template.


        #### Create Parts

        The following are key points about creating parts in your templates, as shown in the example:

        * The "id" field may be supplied, and it must be unique.

        * By default, templates are created as drafts.  If you would like to directly publish a template upon creation, set the "published" field to true.

        * Open and click tracking may be enable/disabled at the template level using the "open_tracking" and
        "click_tracking" fields.

        * The "from" field may be a JSON object composed of "email" and "name".

        * A "Reply-To" header may be specified using the "reply_to" field.

        * Both "text" and "html" may be provided.

        * Additional headers may be specified in the "headers" JSON dictionary.


        #### Create RFC822

        Fully formed email_rfc822 content may be provided instead of the "text", "html", "from", and "subject" parts, as shown in the example.

        The result will include a "last_update_time" field. The "last_update_time" is the time the template was last updated, for both draft and published versions.

        Update an existing template by specifying its ID in the URI path and use a **template object** as the PUT request body.
        By default, the update will result in a new draft version, but the published version can be overwritten directly by using the **update_published** query parameter.

        The "name" field may be modified, but the "id" field is read only.

        If a content object is provided in the update request, it must
        contain all relevant content fields whether they are being changed or not.
        The new content will completely overwrite the existing content.

        The example shows an update that will rename the template, enable open tracking,
        and update the content all in one API call. All content fields are included whether they are being
        changed or not.

        Publishing a template is a specific case of an update.  The body of the PUT
        request should contain the `"published": true` field as shown in the example. The
        **update_published** query parameter does not apply.

        If a tracking domain is specified, it will replace any currently specified tracking domain.  If the supplied tracking domain is a blank string, it will clear any currently specified tracking domain. Note that if a tracking domain is not specified, any currently specified tracking domain will remain intact.

        If a dkim object is provided in the update request, it must contain all relevant fields whether they are being changed or not.  The new dkim object will completely overwrite the existing one.

        To remove the DKIM Signing Domain Identifier for a Sending Domain, use the empty string for the value of the dkim.signing_domain field. ( **Note**: dkim.signing_domain is only available in SparkPost Elite. )
